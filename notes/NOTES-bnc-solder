Soldering BNC connectors is an incredible pain in the tail. This is because
the shroud pins have good heat conductivity and the shroud has large
thermal mass.

I'd originally tried preheating using a hot air gun, but my current method
is to put the iron tip next to the shroud pin, put a blob of solder on it
(touching the pin and the via), and then wait until the pin heats up enough
for the solder to wet it. This takes about 1 full minute for the first pin,
and 10-20 seconds for the each of the other three shroud pins.
