For painting the lettering on 3D printed SynchBox panels, I used syringes
and nail polish.

I had best results using a 1 cc syringe, drawing with an 18 ga needle, and
dispensing with a 23 ga needle.


McMaster-Carr part numbers:

1 cc syringes		7510A806
23 ga tips		75165A759
18 ga tips		75165A249


For black plastic, bright yellow nail polish worked best.
