This requires its own udev rules.
The USB port is for programming only (detecting as a "USBtinyISP").
Serial communication requires an FTDI cable.
There are 3V and 5V versions of the board, with different regulators. They 
can be distinguished by the voltage output pin's label.

This does low-speed USB in software from the boot loader. If it's 
USB-connected, it's programmed over USB, looking like a USBtinyISP; if it's 
FTDI-connected, it's programmed like an Uno (compatible boot loaders).
To trigger the boot loader, press-and-release reset. The boot loader times 
out after 10 seconds.
