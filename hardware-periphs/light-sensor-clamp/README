Each clamp consists of three 3D printed parts, and two McMaster-Carr parts.

The 3D printed parts are the body of the clamp (yellow in the assembly
diagram), the wire-holding cap (green in the assembly diagram), and the
sensor locator cap (red in the assembly diagram).

To assemble the clamp:

- Affix the foot (p/n 6111K451) to its feed hole in the clamp body, either
by gluing the foot's mounting nut to the body or by gluing a 1/4"-20 threaded
insert into the feed hole in the clamp body.
- Verify that the foot travels freely, and glue the knob (p/n 6214K26) to
the foot's threaded rod.
- Feed the TEPT4400 phototransistor's leads through the locator cap's holes.
- Feed the BNC pigtail's leads through the body of the clamp out of the
sensor hole.
- Solder the phototransistor's leads to the BNC pigtail's leads, using
heat shrink or tape to avoid short circuits.
- Press-fit the locator cap into the clamp body.
- Slide the wire cap on to the BNC pigtail's leads.
- Press-fit the wire cap on to the clamp body.
