This code is intended to interface with the "Adafruit Pro Trinket 5V", which
is a smaller-form-factor variant of the Arudino Pro/Arduino Pro Mini, using
an ATmega328P chip at 16 MHz (as with the Arduino Uno).

An Adafruit "Nunchucky" board was used as the Wii Nunchuck break-out adapter.
If memory serves, it mated directly with the digital I/O pins on the
Pro Trinket, but it's been many years so I no longer remember the details.
