Subject: Re: new nunchuk idea


   As with the Neurarduino code, you can dump it all into a sketchbook 
directory and build it using the IDE as-is, or you can use "make -f 
Makefile.neuravr" to build against the "neuravr" libraries that I'd made 
for the Neurarduino and related hardware.

   The custom libraries don't have I2C yet, so I recommend using the 
Arduino IDE if you want it to actually sense nunchuck data.


   To talk to the dongle, connect via USB serial port at 115200 baud.

   The status LED is blinking on and off when it can't find the nunchuck, 
is solid-on with an off-blip every 2 seconds when it found the nunchuck 
but you haven't requested data, and is off with a pair of on-blips every 2 
seconds when it's streaming data to you.

   Pulling digital pin 8 to ground triggers "automatic" mode, where it 
starts streaming on startup rather than waiting for you to ask it to. In 
that mode, it omits timestamps and sends data as fast as possible 
(equivalent to LIN 0, KIN 0, LTS 0, LOG 1).


   I'll bring the dongle (and Marcus's Neurarduino) back to Marcus's desk 
as soon as I've finished taking measurements for the case.
