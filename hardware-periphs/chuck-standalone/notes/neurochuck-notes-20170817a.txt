Subject: Neurochuck firmware


   In case anyone besides me wants to flash more of these, here's the 
firmware image for the version of the "neurochuck" I have now. This should 
work on any 16 MHz ATmega328P system, including the Uno and Pro Trinket.

   (The 3.3V Pro Trinket runs at 12 MHz instead, which will throw off 
timing, including baud rate timing.)


   It supplies "power" and "ground" to Ain3 (C3) and Ain2 (C2), 
respectively. It uses the LED on Dio13 (B5/SCK) for status indication. If 
you pull down Dio8 (B0) during boot, it'll start spitting out packed data 
automatically without you having to tell it to (this is how it would work 
if I put it in the Neurarduino box).

   The command interface is very similar to the Neurarduino's. Connect at 
115200 baud, type "hlp" or "?" for help, and "idq" to query the device 
type string (so that you can tell this and the neurarduino apart).

   With timestamps enabled (default for manual mode), output looks like:

   TnnnnnnnnJxxyycLxxyyzz

   Without timestamps (default for autostart mode), output looks like:

   JxxyycLxxyyzz

   Joystick (J) and accelerometer (L) values are 8-bit hex-encoded bytes. 
Button values are one hex digit (0-3 in practice; C is bit 0 and Z is 
bit 1).


   If you want a packaged version immediately, I have a case on-hand that I 
can put it into if you don't mind rough-cut holes. Otherwise let me know 
how you want me to proceed with it.
